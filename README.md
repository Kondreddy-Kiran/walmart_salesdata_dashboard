Effective Walmart Sales Data Dashboard using Tableau:
The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of Walmart's sales performance, including sales by product category, region, and time period. The dashboard also includes visualizations that highlight key trends and insights, such as which products are selling well, which regions are driving growth, and how sales have changed over time.

The dashboard is designed to be easy to use and navigate, with clear and concise visualizations. It is also interactive, allowing users to drill down into the data to explore specific trends or insights.

I believe that this dashboard is a valuable tool for Walmart executives and managers. It can help them to track sales performance, identify trends, and make informed decisions about how to improve the company's sales.
